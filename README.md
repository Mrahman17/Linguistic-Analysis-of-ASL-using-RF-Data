# Linguistic-Analysis-of-ASL-using-RF-Data

4 signer and 8 non-signers were recorded producing 100 high-frequency ASL
signs using FMCW radar. The speed of signing is measured by tracing the Doppler velocity of the
upper and lower envelopes of the micro-Doppler signature. The upper envelope represents the
radial velocity of the fastest point moving towards the radar, while the lower envelope gives the
speed of the fastest point on the body moving away from the radar. Thus, envelopes provide a
means for learning the speed of the hands during signing. The higher order derivatives (HOD),
such as acceleration and jerk, are calculated by taking first and second derivatives of the envelope.
The HODs are important physical and linguistic features of signing.

Using mean of all HODs and their standard deviations as features, the data from fluent signers can be
separated from imitation signersâ€™ data in feature space. Moreover, the signals produced
during two-handed signs are higher in signal energy than the signal of one-handed signs; thus for
both the imitation and fluent signers, sign type (one- vs. two-handed) can be identified from the
radar micro-Doppler signature
